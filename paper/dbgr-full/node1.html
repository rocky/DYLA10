Introduction</A>
</H1>
I have written debuggers for a number of dynamic
languages&nbsp;[#!rdebug!#,#!bashdb!#,#!pydb!#,#!remake!#,#!pydbgr!#,#!rbdbgr!#,#!kshdb!#,#!zshdb!#]
and have found that additional run-time support invariably needs to be
added. Compare debugging capabilities typically available now with
those Smalltalk, a language 30 years old&nbsp;[#!smalltalk!#].

<P>
It seems that the state of the art in debugging has been not been
improving. The Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are not
worse, but the foundation that they have to interact with is. Test-
and behavior-driven development, interactive shells, modular and
functional programming, and proving programs correct are all valuable
techniques which reduce the need for debuggers and debugging, but they
do not eliminate it.

<P>
Practical support for debugging is often weak. Consider a typical
systems administrator who may not be all that interested in
programming languages and programming-language theory. When something
goes wrong, he or she may have to troubleshoot and fix a complex,
non-modular, untestable program written by someone else. And instead
of having a simple, lightweight tool to diagnose the problem, there
may be only a complex and heavyweight IDE that poses problems of its
own.

<P>
At the other, theoretical, end of the spectrum there are authors and
teachers of a particular programming language who devote much more
time to the programming language's theory and design than to the
mundane task of debugging an existing program. Consequently, in many
reference manuals for popular dynamic programming languages like Ruby,
Scala, or Python, there is only a little sketchy information on
debuggers or debugging.

<P>
Perhaps such lack of interest in debuggers is partly because the
debuggers are very weak, which is in turn because of the lack of
support inside the language: a little bit of a bootstrapping
problem. And perhaps lack of support partially stems from confusion
about what is needed at run time, and about how to write a debugger in
a modular, testable, and debuggable way--it is an unfortunate fact
that many debuggers cannot debug themselves.

<P>
So, first I outline how to structure and write a modular
debugger. Then I describe some of the support features commonly
missing from programming languages. Many of these are not specific to
debugging or dynamic languages; better error-location reporting is one
of these.

<P>
