Breakpoint support</A>
</H3>

<P>
Most dynamic languages that implement trace hooks, such as Python,
POSIX shells, and Ruby, do not allow setting breakpoints inside the
interpreter. A notable exception to this is Perl, ironic since it is
one of the older languages. Given this, the hook code must look at
location information and determine when a breakpoint has been
encountered. Switching back and forth between running program and hook
code, and the additional overhead of checking position information,
are slow. When debugging a program slows it down, the debugger can not
be used to find race-condition bugs. Furthermore, the programmer is
discouraged from using a debugger, and then has to devise ways of
circumventing flaws in the run-time debugging. A common workaround is
to change the source code to put a call to the debugger where the
programmer wants to stop. This allows the program to run at full speed
until the point when the debugger is needed, making use of dynamic
facility of the programming language to pull in code at any time.

<P>
However what is really needed is a way to register a stopping point
inside the interpreter. Full support for handling conditions under
which one needs to stop is not needed. Even support for one-time or
temporary breakpoints is not necessary--that can all be done in the
higher-level code outside of the interpreter. But some support inside
the interpreter is extremely useful in order to handle breakpoints
efficiently.

<P>
Here are some techniques for allowing for breakpoints inside an
interpreter. One of the oldest techniques, used for example in IBM
mainframe assembly code, is to patch over the instruction sequence
with a ``trap'' instruction&nbsp;[#!rubinius!#]. One needs to store the
overwritten instruction and simulate it when the trap is over. With a
virtual machine, a similar and perhaps simpler way is to store a trap
bit in the VM opcode. In my experimental Ruby 1.9 debugger, I allocate
a parallel byte vector for each instruction sequence on demand where
the programmer has set a breakpoint. I did this for simplicity of
implementation, but it also has an advantage that since it does not
change the instruction sequence, it allows for better security
in checking for tampering with the code&nbsp;[#!grayhat!#].
