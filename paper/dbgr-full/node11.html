Command Processor, Commands and SubCommands</A>
</H2>

<P>
The command processor mediates between the actual commands (or
``view'' of MVC) and the internal state of the debugger or run-time
system (analogous to the ``model'' of MVC). This might be in the form
of a command-line interface, or it might be XML.

<P>
In some debuggers, such as perldb or pdb, each command is a
method. However in Object-oriented languages it is useful to make each
command be its own class, a subclass of a general command class. Doing
this makes it simpler to associate commonly needed properties with the
command--help for the command, short help, what category of commands
this command is in, and so on. Furthermore making each command its own
class object facilitates making subcommands for the command. Some
examples of commands which have subcommands in gdb-like debuggers are
``info,'' ``set,'' and ``show.''  Subcommands of ``info'' include
``program'' (show information about the program debugged), and
``args'' (argument variables of the current stack frame). By the same
token, making each subcommand be a class facilitates giving it
properties and adding subcommands to the subcommand. A last benefit of
making each command in its own class and putting a small number of
these in a file is that it is easy to test individual commands in
isolation.

<P>
To collect commands, I put each command in its own file. Some
debuggers&nbsp;[#!rdebug!#] group related commands like gdb ``up'' (move
up a stack frame), and ``down'' (move down a stack frame) in a single
file. However I find it simpler just to have one command per
file. These commands are collected in a ``command'' directory. Dynamic
languages then can just load all the files located in a
directory. This also makes it possible to allow for user customization
of commands via a user command directory which is separate from the
debugger's base command directory. Likewise commands which require
OS-specific or language-level features can be grouped and
isolated this way. Lastly if there is a bug in that command one can
fix the file and reload it thereby fixing bugs in debugger commands
without having to leave the debugger and redo context to get to the
point where the bug is seen.
