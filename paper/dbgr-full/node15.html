High-level and low-level debugging</A>
</H1>
There is a dichotomy between high-level (language level) debuggers and
low-level (VM instruction) debuggers. The popular debugger gdb is
basically a low-level debugger that tries to add support for some
high-level languages. Debuggers can also go the other way around, but
they usually do not. Ruby and Python debuggers (other than the ones I
have written) do not allow for VM or byte-code inspection. In one case
where I requested more access to the lower-level structures, the VM
writer resisted because of fear of giving low-level access to an
average programmer. Debuggers in dynamic languages, then, are not seen
as tools for the compiler writer, i.e., for testing code
generation or optimization techniques. This is perhaps another reason
why support for debuggers in such languages is weak.

<P>
Some debuggers of optimized code ``decompile'' the optimized code or
undo some of the transformations that the optimization has
performed&nbsp;[#!debug-optimized!#]. While this very helpful, it also
increases the likelihood of Heisenbugs--bugs that disappear when a
debugger brought in. Code which has a bug due to a race condition
may suffer the Heisenbug effect. So while decompiling optimized code
can be very useful, a debugger also needs to debug optimized code. And
here what is needed is transparency regarding transformations that
have taken place.

<P>
Often the debugger is not seen as a vehicle for allowing the
programmer to understand what optimization and code improvements have
been performed on the program. In Ruby, a compiler-option table is
removed after compilation; it is not kept for dynamic inspection
(although this may be fixed in a future release). And recursion
elimination is turned off by default for fear that it would confuse
programmers. But adding a small amount of information to the object
would allow a debugger to report such transformations when they occur,
and I think that would be sufficient.

<P>
With gdb and gcc, programmers often debug optimized code, where
sequential statements might be run in a different order from that
given in the source. Unfortunately, code optimizers typically do not
record information about the code motion, although this would not be
difficult, and it would help a programmer follow execution of the
program.

<P>
Suppose that whenever an instruction is moved by a code optimizer,
information indicating that the instruction is not in its original
location is recorded alongside the instruction stream. Then whenever a
debugger is stopped on that instruction, it could issue a warning. If
the optimizer recorded that the code was moved ``up,'' the debugger
would scan forward in the instruction sequence until a branching point
for the first instruction that was not moved. This location could be
reported as the current position, noting that an instruction from
further down is about to be run. A similar procedure would apply if an
instruction moved ``down,'' but scanning backward rather than forward.

<P>
This example brings up a question regarding the high-level
vs. low-level dichotomy: do we try to hide underlying
mechanisms or to expose them? There is no one set answer. For code
motion, the example above does both. Although programmers generally
prefer to think of code in a higher-level way that matches the
source code, upon programmer's request, or when not enough information
has been recorded to confidently present things in a higher-level way,
the full low-level details should be available.

<P>
