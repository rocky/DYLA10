Trace Filtering</A>
</H2>

<P>
The debuggers I have been working on recently have a layer that
handles some basic kinds of filtering to decide whether or not to run
a trace hook. This accommodates some common situations which are
described below. Also the trace filtering also adds support for
chaining hooks. Python and Ruby's API does not allow for hook
chaining, even though underlying support is there in Ruby. Hook
chaining allows profiling and debugging to use the same underlying
mechanism.

<P>
One common situation is that there may be a debugger method that needs
to set up some of the debugging environment. Since this routine is
part of the debugger package rather than the debugged program, one
does not want to stop inside it. For example in rbdbgr there is a
``debugger'' method which one can add to the source code to force an
explicit call to the debugger trace hook.

<P>
Two ways I have seen this handled are either to arrange to set the
tracing bit on as the last instruction of the routine; or to count the
number of events that the routine may trigger, and tell the hook to
skip that many trace events. Neither of these methods is robust or
easy to use. Instead in the trace filter I have a list of method names
that can be registered which get ignored.

<P>
Another thing a trace filter might do is filter out certain types of
events. However this is best done inside the runtime, otherwise tracing
slows down. Both Python and Ruby do provide this kind of trace
filtering but in both cases the kinds of filters are fixed. Profiling
works for calls and returns, while debugging works for all events.

<P>
