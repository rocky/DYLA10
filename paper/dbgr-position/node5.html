Breakpoint support</A>
</H2>
Many dynamic languages provide debugging support via a trace mechanism
which issues a callback to a hook. The debugger writer develops the hook
in the language to be debugged and makes a call to register
it. Python, POSIX shells, and Ruby all work this way. However in
none of these languages can one set breakpoints for the interpreter
within the interpreter. A notable exception to this is Perl.

<P>
The hook code must look at location information and determine when a
breakpoint has been encountered. Switching back and forth between
running program and hook code, and the additional overhead of checking
position information, are slow. When debugging a program slows it
down, the programmer is discouraged from using a debugger, and then
has to devise ways of circumventing flaws in the run-time
debugging. The most common workaround is to change the source code to
put a call to the debugger where the programmer wants to stop. This
allows the program to run at full speed until the point when the
debugger is needed, making use of dynamic facility of the programming
language to pull in code at any time.

<P>
However what is really needed is a way to register a stopping point
inside the interpreter. Full support for handling conditions under
which one needs to stop is not needed. Even support for one-time or
temporary breakpoints is not necessary--that can all be done in the
higher-level code outside of the interpreter. But some support inside
the interpreter is extremely useful in order to handle breakpoints
well.

<P>
Here are some techniques for allowing for breakpoints inside an
interpreter: One of the oldest techniques, used for example in IBM
mainframe assembly code, is to patch over the instruction sequence
with a ``trap'' instruction. One needs to store the overwritten
instruction and simulate it when the trap is over. With a virtual
machine, a similar and perhaps simpler way is to store a trap bit in
the VM opcode. In my experimental Ruby 1.9 debugger, I allocate a
parallel byte vector for each instruction sequence on demand where the
programmer has set a breakpoint.
