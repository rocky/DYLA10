<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
High-level and low-level debugging</A>
</H1>
There is a dichotomy between high-level (language level) debuggers and
low-level (VM instruction) debuggers. The popular debugger gdb is
basically a low-level debugger that tries to add support for some
high-level languages. Debuggers can also go the other way around, but
they usually do not. Ruby and Python debuggers (other than the ones I
have written) do not allow for VM or bytecode inspection. In one case
where I requested more access to the lower-level structures, the VM
writer resisted because of fear of giving low-level access to an
average programmer. Debuggers in dynamic languages, then, are not seen
as tools for the compiler writer, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">i.e.,</SPAN> for testing code generation
or optimization techniques. This is yet another reason why support for
debuggers in such languages is weak.

<P>
Similarly the debugger is not seen as a vehicle for allowing the
programmer to understand what optimization and code improvements have
been performed on the program. In Ruby, a compiler-option table is
removed after compilation; it is not kept for dynamic inspection
(although this may be fixed in a future release). And recursion
elimination is turned off by default for fear that it would confuse
programmers. Instead, adding a small amount of information to the
object would allow a debugger to report such transformations when they
occur, and I think that would be sufficient.

<P>
With gdb and gcc, programmers often debug optimized code, where
sequential statements might be run in a different order from that
given in the program. Unfortunately, code optimizers typically do not
record information about the code motion performed on a program,
although this would not be difficult, and it would help a programmer
follow execution of the program.

<P>
Suppose that whenever an instruction is moved by a code optimizer,
information indicating that the instruction is not in its original
location is recorded alongside the instruction stream. Then whenever a
debugger is stopped on that instruction, it could issue a
warning. If the optimizer recorded that the code was moved ``up,'' the
debugger would scan forward in the instruction sequence until a
branching point for the first instruction that was not moved. This
location could be reported as the current position, noting that an
instruction from further down is about to be run. A similar procedure
would apply if an instruction moved ``down,'' but scanning backward
rather than forward.

<P>
This example brings up a question regarding the high-level
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">vs.</SPAN> low level dichotomy: do we try to hide underlying
mechanisms or to expose them? There is no one set answer. For code
motion, the example above does both. Although programmers generally
prefer to think of code in a higher-level way that matches the
source-code, upon programmer's request, or when not enough information
has been recorded to confidently present things in a higher-level way,
the full low-level details should be available.
