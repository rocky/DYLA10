Introduction</A>
</H1>
I have written debuggers for a number of dynamic languages, and have
found that additional run-time support invariably needs to be
added. It seems that the state of the art in debugging has been not
been improving. It is not that the Integrated Development Environments
(IDEs) are worse, but that the foundation that they have to interact
with is. Test- and behavior-driven development, interactive shells, modular
and functional programming, and proving programs correct are all
valuable techniques which reduce the importance of debuggers and
debugging, but they do not eliminate it.

<P>
Practical support for debugging is often weak. Consider a typical
systems administrator who may not be all that interested in
programming languages and programming-language theory. When something
goes wrong, he or she may have to troubleshoot and fix a complex,
non-modular, untestable program written by someone
else. And instead of having a simple, lightweight tool to diagnose the
problem, there may be only a complex and heavyweight IDE that poses
problems of its own.

<P>
At the other, theoretical, end of the spectrum there are authors and
teachers of a particular programming language who devote much more
time to the programming language's theory and design than to the
mundane task of debugging an existing program. Consequently, in many
reference manuals for popular dynamic programming languages like Ruby,
Scala, or Python, there is only a little sketchy information on
debuggers or debugging.

<P>
Perhaps such lack of interest in debuggers is partially because the
debuggers are very weak, which is in turn because of the lack of support
inside the language: a little bit of a bootstrapping problem. And
perhaps lack of support partially stems from confusion about what is
needed at run time, and about how to write a debugger in a modular,
testable, and debuggable way--it is an unfortunate fact that many
debuggers cannot debug themselves.

<P>
Below I describe some of the commonly missing features. Many of these
are not specific to debugging or dynamic
languages; better error-location reporting is one of these.
